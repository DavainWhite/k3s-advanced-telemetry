## Overview

K3s Advanced Telemetry is a fully open-source, pre-configured observability stack for lightweight Kubernetes (K3s) deployments. It provides a robust monitoring and alerting solution leveraging Prometheus, Grafana, and Alertmanager, optimized for resource-efficient telemetry collection in edge, cloud, and on-premise environments.

Designed as a plug-and-play telemetry solution, this project offers seamless deployment, pre-built dashboards, and a scalable architecture to meet both development and production observability needs.

## Features

- ðŸš€ **One-Command Deployment**: Deploy the entire telemetry stack effortlessly with `tilt up`.
- ðŸ“Š **Pre-configured Dashboards**: Includes Grafana dashboards for Kubernetes, Prometheus, and cloud-native applications.
- ðŸ”” **Integrated Alerting**: Features Alertmanager for proactive notifications and incident response.
- ðŸ”„ **Lightweight & Efficient**: Optimized for K3s and resource-constrained environments.
- ðŸ”§ **Production-Ready**: Adaptable for local, edge, and cloud deployments.

## Deployment

Ensure [Tilt](https://tilt.dev/) is installed, then deploy with:

```sh
tilt up
```

This will automatically provision the full telemetry stack within your Kubernetes cluster.

## Architecture

The K3s Advanced Telemetry stack consists of:
- **Grafana**: Real-time visualization of metrics with pre-configured dashboards.
- **Prometheus**: Scalable time-series data collection and monitoring.
- **Alertmanager**: Automated alerting for anomaly detection and incident management.
- **Kubernetes Manifests**: Managed with Kustomize for easy adaptation to various environments.
